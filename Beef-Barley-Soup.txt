Beef Barley Soup (Recipe from Tina)
	30 servings
1 pound ground beef (I usually use ground turkey)	(6 lb, 3kg)
1 cup chopped onions	(7-8 cups)
1 tablespoon minced garlic	(7-8 tablespoons)

In a large pot, sauté over medium heat until meat is cooked and onions are soft. Drain any fat. Then add:

6 cups of beef broth (for church lunch use water with bouillon cubes or powder)	
	(11.5 litres)
½ cup pearl barley	(3.5-4 cups)

Bring to a boil; simmer for 20 minutes.  Then add:

½ cup diced turnip	(3.5-4 cups)
½ cup diced carrot	(3.5-4 cups)
½ cup diced, peeled potato	(3.5-4 cups)
(Rita: if you like add any other veggies like green beans, zucchini, celery, etc.)
2 teaspoons tomato paste	(16 teaspoons = 1/3 cup)
½ teaspoon thyme (or one bay leaf, or marjoram, or oregano)	(4 teaspoons)	
black pepper	(to taste as needed)

Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add salt to taste.


This is the basic recipe. Some things I’ve tried are:
* Omit meat and add ½ cup green lentils with the barley.
* Use 3 cups tomato juice and 3 cups broth, and omit the tomato paste.
* If you rinse the barley in cold water several times before adding, the soup stays more clear-looking, and is not as thick. My family likes the thicker soup so I always just throw it in.
